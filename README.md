# DSA100: "Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in 100 Days using Java"
This repository is ultimate guide to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in 100 days. Each day focuses on solving one well-structured problem, progressing from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.


Welcome to the **DSA100 Challenge**, a 100-day journey to strengthen your problem-solving skills and master DSA concepts. This repository provides well-structured problems, solutions, and resources from beginner to advanced levels.

## How It Works
- Each day focuses on **one DSA problem**.
- The problems progress in difficulty from basic to advanced.

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a day's challenge:
- **DayXX/** contains:
  - `Problem.md`: Problem statement with examples.
  - `Solution.java`: Implementation in C++/Python.
  - `README.md`: Summary of the day's challenge.

## Progress Tracker
| Day  | Problem                              | Status     |
|------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| Day 1| minimum and maximum of an array      |  pending   |
| Day 2| ....                                 |   pending  |
